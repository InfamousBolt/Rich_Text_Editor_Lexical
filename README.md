> A Rich Text Editor built using [lexical](https://lexical.dev/) which also supports Lexical Nodes to Markdown conversion and vice versa along with various other features such as mentions and alignments implemented using Lexical plugins. A tester page to compare Basic HTML(from Quill) to Lexical Content was also developed.

## Tech-stack used
ReactJS, Typescript, Lexical TPL, BootStrap

## Custom Transformers
Custom Markdown Transformers to support mentions, underline, alignment and other conversions which are not supported by Core Markdown were added to this project. You can read more about them [here](https://lexical.dev/docs/packages/lexical-markdown)
