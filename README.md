> A Rich Text Editor built using [lexical](https://lexical.dev/) which also support Lexical Nodes to Markdown conversion and vice versa along with various other features such as mentions and alignments implemented using Lexical plugins. A tester page to compare Basic HTML(from Quill) to Lexical Content was also developed.
